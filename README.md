# Commerce
 Django project using database models
 
 * This auction site allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, and comment on those listings; all according to the user signed in.
 * Form models should be used in this project but I decided to stick with regular HTML forms.
 * The superuser username is: mazen, and the password is: mazen3042000. You might need it.
 * When you visit the website, make sure to regisetr a new account to try all of its feautures! Visit the website at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
 **Django must be installed first, run in cmd the command: "python manage.py runserver" when you are in the project's folder directory.
